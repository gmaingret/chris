# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15 for v2.1 M007 Decision Archive milestone)

**Core value:** Greg can deposit any memory, thought, or feeling into Chris and later ask questions that Chris answers by searching everything Greg has ever told him — with full fidelity, no data loss, and genuine contextual understanding across English, French, and Russian.
**Current focus:** Phase 18 — synthetic-fixture-live-accountability-integration-suite

## Current Position

Phase: 18
Plan: Not started
Next: `/gsd-plan-phase 13` — decompose Schema & Lifecycle Primitives into plans
Status: Executing Phase 18
Last activity: 2026-04-16

## v2.1 Milestone Roadmap (Phases 13-18)

- Phase 13 — Schema & Lifecycle Primitives (guards C4, M1)
- Phase 14 — Capture Flow (guards C1, C2, C3, M5, M6)
- Phase 15 — Deadline Trigger & Sweep Integration (guards C5, M3)
- Phase 16 — Resolution + ACCOUNTABILITY Mode (guards C7, M2, M6, m3)
- Phase 17 — `/decisions` Command & Accuracy Stats (guards C2, C6, M4)
- Phase 18 — Synthetic Fixture + Live ACCOUNTABILITY Suite (guards C7 flatline)

## Shipped Milestones

- **v1.0 Living Memory through Validation** — 2026-04-13 (Phases 1-5)
- **v2.0 M006 Trustworthy Chris** — 2026-04-15 (Phases 6-12, 19 plans, 26/26 requirements)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions in force for M007

Full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Most load-bearing for M007:

- D001 three-tier LLM (Haiku for stakes classification + accuracy scoring)
- D004 append-only Pensieve — `decision_events` extends this invariant to lifecycle
- D010 two-phase trigger execution — applies to decision trigger (regex→Haiku stakes) and deadline trigger (SQL gate→surface)
- D017/D018/D019 per-phase commits, no skipped tests, explicit production deploy
- D020 pattern-based detection for bounded problems — reused for EN/FR/RU trigger regex
- D021 `franc` language detection — thread Greg's language through capture/resolution
- D023/D032 live integration tests vs real Sonnet — mandatory for ACCOUNTABILITY mode
- D025 praise quarantine bypassed at prompt level for flattery-forbidden modes — ACCOUNTABILITY follows COACH/PSYCHOLOGY pattern
- D027 The Hard Rule — explicitly forbidden in ACCOUNTABILITY system prompt

### Pending Todos

- Execute `/gsd-plan-phase 13` to plan Schema & Lifecycle Primitives.
- During Phase 16 planning, decide: ACCOUNTABILITY as new mode vs COACH extension (PITFALLS C7 accepts either).

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Between-phases pause for M006 (≥1 week real Telegram use before M007) acknowledged; user confirmed proceeding with M007 planning now. Post-M007, pause ≥2 weeks of real Telegram use before M008 Episodic Consolidation.
